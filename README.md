Build an mini-app in react &amp; node

## Software Engineering Challenge
Please complete the following challenge using any language and tools you are comfortable
with.
1. Create a Single Page Web Application (SPA) that
2. Captures a personâ€™s name
3. Sends the name to a server
4. The server-side application should

* a. Store the first name and last name in a database.
* b. Calculate the sum of the ascii values for each character
* c. Calculate the largest number of consecutive 0s in a binary representation of
that value and
* d. Return that number to the SPA for display.

Code should be stored in GitHub.
You will be given half an hour to present your solution and answer questions.
Your solution should run either locally or on cloud infrastructure but you must be able to
demonstrate it to us.
Example: Ann Other.
Sum of the ascii values for each character is:


Value | Ascii
--- | ---
A | 65
n | 110
O | 79
t | 116
h | 104
e | 101
r | 114
Sum | 831

831 in binary is 1100111111.
The largest number of consecutive zeros is therefore 2.
